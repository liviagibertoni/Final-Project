# 🎬 Generative AI Final Project – Movie Revenue Prediction

This project was developed as a final assignment for the Generative AI for Data Science course.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Movie Genre Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therohithanand/movie-genre-classification)
- Size: 50,000 movie records
- Target variable: `BoxOffice_USD`
- Features include: Year, Budget, Rating, Votes, Awards, Duration, and Critic Reviews

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Use generative AI to support data exploration and model development
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Compare Linear, Polynomial, and Ridge regression models
- Use Grid Search to tune hyperparameters

## 📊 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data.csv` | Raw dataset used in the project |
| `analysis.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with all code and analysis |
| `chat.txt` | Transcript of all prompts and answers from AI used to develop the project |

## 🧠 Models Used

- Linear Regression (univariate and multivariate)
- Polynomial Regression (degree 2)
- Ridge Regression with hyperparameter tuning

## ✅ Key Results

- The Ridge model with tuned alpha had the best R² score and lowest error.
- Generative AI was used to assist with code generation, cleaning logic, and prompt construction.

## 📎 Submission

All files were submitted to MyFire and documented in this GitHub repo as required.
