Please help me write a markdown introduction section for my Jupyter Notebook. It should describe the dataset, list the column names with short explanations, and include the Kaggle link.


O ChatGPT disse:
Here‚Äôs a clean and professional Markdown introduction for your Jupyter Notebook:

üé¨ Movie Genre Classification ‚Äì Final Data Science Project
üìå Introduction
This project explores the Movie Genre Classification dataset available on Kaggle. The goal is to analyze and model movie-related data to classify or understand genres based on various features.

The dataset contains a rich set of movie attributes, allowing us to apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling techniques.

üìÅ Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about over 4,800 movies and contains the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Title	The name of the movie
Overview	A short summary or synopsis of the movie
Genre	The main genre(s) of the movie
Original_Language	The language in which the movie was originally produced
Release_Date	The official release date of the movie
Runtime	Duration of the movie in minutes
Vote_Average	The average rating based on user votes
Vote_Count	The total number of votes received
Popularity	A metric reflecting the popularity score of the movie
Tagline	The promotional tagline or catchphrase of the movie
Director	Name of the movie‚Äôs director
Production_Company	The main company or studio that produced the movie
Budget	Estimated production budget in US dollars
Revenue	Global box office revenue in US dollars
Country	The country or countries where the movie was produced

üîó Source
You can access and download the dataset from Kaggle here:

Write a Python code to:
1. Load the file 'data.csv' using pandas.
2. Show basic info of the dataset.
3. Display the first 5 rows.
4. Print the number of missing values in each column.


O ChatGPT disse:
Here's the Python code that performs all four tasks using pandas:

python
Copiar
Editar
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 2. Show basic info
print("Basic Information:")
df.info()

# 3. Display the first 5 rows
print("\nFirst 5 Rows:")
print(df.head())

# 4. Print the number of missing values in each column
print("\nMissing Values per Column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
This code gives you a quick overview of your dataset and checks for missing data, which is crucial for the next steps in your analysis. Let me know if you want to visualize missing data as well.

<ipython-input-1-5eae5a62c273>:1: DeprecationWarning: 
Pyarrow will become a required dependency of pandas in the next major release of pandas (pandas 3.0),
(to allow more performant data types, such as the Arrow string type, and better interoperability with other libraries)
but was not found to be installed on your system.
If this would cause problems for you,
please provide us feedback at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54466
        
  import pandas as pd


O ChatGPT disse:
The warning you're seeing is just a DeprecationWarning, not an error. It means that in the future (specifically in pandas 3.0), the pyarrow library will be required to enable certain features ‚Äî but your code will still run fine for now.

‚úÖ What You Can Do:
You have two options:

‚úÖ Option 1: Ignore the Warning (Code Works Fine)
If everything else runs as expected, you can leave it alone ‚Äî the warning is just informational.

‚úÖ Option 2: Install pyarrow (Recommended for Future Compatibility)
Run this in a code cell or terminal to install pyarrow:

python
Copiar
Editar
!pip install pyarrow
Then, re-run your code. This will eliminate the warning and make your setup future-proof for pandas 3.0.

Let me know if you'd like to suppress the warning temporarily or need help setting up a virtual environment.

O ChatGPT disse:
You're seeing that error because you're likely running the notebook in a restricted environment (e.g., Kaggle, Coursera, or some browser-based platform like JupyterLite or IBM Skills Network Labs) where !pip install or system() calls are not allowed.

‚úÖ Good News:
The warning about pyarrow is not critical ‚Äî your code will still work. It‚Äôs just a future heads-up from pandas.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Go ahead and run the original code ‚Äî it will work fine without pyarrow for now. Here's a reminder of the core code:

python
Copiar
Editar
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Show basic info
print("Basic Information:")
df.info()

# Display the first 5 rows
print("\nFirst 5 Rows:")
print(df.head())

# Print missing values
print("\nMissing Values per Column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
If you'd like to suppress the warning temporarily just to keep the output clean, you can add this at the top:

python
Copiar
Editar
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
Let me know where you're running the notebook ‚Äî I can give you even more specific advice based on your platform.

2. Shows the number of unique values in categorical columns.
3. Plots histograms for numeric variables in the dataset.


O ChatGPT disse:
Here is the Python code that accomplishes all three tasks using pandas and matplotlib:

python
Copiar

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 1. Descriptive statistics for numeric columns

üîç What This Does:
Uses boxplot() from pandas to create one box plot per numeric column.

Arranges them vertically using subplot() for comparison.

Highlights outliers as individual points outside the whiskers.

‚úÖ Conclusion
üîç Model Performance Summary
Among the models tested ‚Äî including simple linear regression, multivariable linear regression, and polynomial regression with Ridge regularization ‚Äî the Ridge Regression with 2nd-degree polynomial features and tuned alpha achieved the best performance. It showed the highest R¬≤ score and the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set, indicating a better balance between model complexity and generalization.

üìà Key Insights
Budget and Votes showed strong positive correlations with BoxOffice_USD, suggesting that higher investment and popularity metrics are predictive of greater box office returns.

Applying polynomial features helped capture non-linear relationships that linear models might miss.

Regularization with Ridge reduced the risk of overfitting when using a high number of polynomial features.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
The dataset may contain incomplete or imprecise financial figures (e.g., missing or zero Budget_USD or BoxOffice_USD values), which can bias the model.

Categorical variables like genre, language, or country were not included in modeling, which could provide valuable predictive signals if encoded appropriately.

External factors (marketing campaigns, competition, critical reception) are not present in the data but may heavily influence movie revenue.

üí° Future Work
Incorporate text-based features like Overview or Tagline using NLP techniques to capture thematic or emotional appeal.

Use categorical encoding to include variables like Genre or Country in the model.

Explore more advanced models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks for potentially better predictive power.
